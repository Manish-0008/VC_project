# Getting Started with Create React App

Welcome to your new React project! This guide will help you set up, run, and manage your application efficiently using Create React App (CRA).

## 📌 Prerequisites

Before you start, ensure you have the following installed:
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (Recommended: LTS version)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (Comes with Node.js) or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)

To check if you have Node.js and npm installed, run:
```sh
node -v
npm -v
```

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1️⃣ Create a New React App
You can create a new React app by running:
```sh
npx create-react-app my-app
cd my-app
```
*Alternatively, if using Yarn:*
```sh
yarn create react-app my-app
cd my-app
```

## 📜 Available Scripts

Inside your project directory, you can use the following commands:

### 🏃‍♂️ `npm start`
Runs the app in development mode.
```sh
npm start
```
Your app will open at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser. Changes will automatically reload the page.

### 🧪 `npm test`
Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode.
```sh
npm test
```
Refer to [Running Tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more details.

### 🏗 `npm run build`
Builds the app for production.
```sh
npm run build
```
This creates an optimized `build` folder with minified and hashed filenames. The output is ready for deployment.
Refer to [Deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### ⚙️ `npm run eject`
If you need full control over the build configurations, you can eject by running:
```sh
npm run eject
```
⚠ **Note:** This is a one-way operation. Once ejected, you cannot revert back.
